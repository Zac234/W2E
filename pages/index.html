    <h1>Zach Benincasa</h1>
    <p>Hello, My name is Zachary, I prefer Zac, and I have always had a passion for technology: learning it, disecting
        it, even go so far as to experiment with it, and whle I do not come from a very tech savvy background, I
        self-taught myself from the ground up. As I continue to learn more and more I hope to help technology get to all
        people and help in the same way it has helped me.
